BOUNDARY CONDITION
% Lines within a "BOUNDARY CONDITION" block that starts with percentage (%) are considered comments
% Beware that placing comments after inputs may give an error or, even worse, not be detected and wield
% unexpected results
% Empty lines are ignored
% The name can be whatever you want, or none
% The values are separated with commas
% Nodes and elements should be entered without breaking lines
% If entered again, the input will be overwritten

Name = Translational prescribed displacement
Condition = Translation
Value = 0,0
Nodes = 13152
Nodes = 1 5
END

BOUNDARY CONDITION
% Define the coordinate system of your choosing, cartesian (x,y), polar (R,theta), horizontal (for a
% single value in the horizontal direction), or vertical (for the vertical direction), the default
% system is cartesian
% When the coordinate system is set to cartesian, it is possible to leave one direction unrestrained
% by leaving its field empty
% This will only work with cartesian coordinates, if attempted with
% polar coordinates, it will suppress the boundary condition
% The "DisplayOrientation" input is used when plotting, but does not interfere with the system
% Distributed loads affect elements
Name = Distributed Load
Condition = Force
CoordinateSystem = Cartesian
Value = ,-2.25e3
DisplayOrientation = Bottom
Elements = 2 3
END

BOUNDARY CONDITION
Name = Rotational prescribed displacement
Condition = Rotation
Value = 0 0
Nodes = 1 5
END

BOUNDARY CONDITION
% Point loads affect nodes
Name = Moment Load
Condition = Moment
Value = -1.5e3
Nodes = 3
END

All that is not within a "BOUNDARY CONDITION" block is considered a comment
The script for parsing the boundary conditions is quite flexible, i attempted to leave as easy, practical,
and intuitive as possible, but it may be edited for further improvements.
